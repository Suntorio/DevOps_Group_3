1.  Deploy an instance with Terraform

2.  Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
    It simplifies IT automation by using a declarative approach, allowing users to define what needs to be done rather than how to do it.

Example:
*Create an inventory file (inventory.ini):
[web_servers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

*Run the playbook
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini nginx_setup.yml
